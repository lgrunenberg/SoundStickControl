# SoundStickControl
This is a little tool for controlling the DSP features of the Harman Kardon Sound Sicks.

I am the proud owner of some really nice looking first revision Harman Kardon Sound Sticks with USB connection. Since i own them i was not pleased with their sound, especially lacking treble. Fortunately they have some basic DSP features, the only downside being that there is no simple tool for controlling them.

**TODO:**
* Provide a GUI with sliders
* Integrate the settings into OS X menu bar
